# 📊 Metrics Lost in Translation

An AI-powered tool that **reconciles KPIs**, **translates business metrics across teams**, and **flags conflicting success metrics** — preventing misalignment between Marketing, Sales, and Product teams.

## 🚀 Features

### Business KPI Glossary Translator
Standardizes business metric definitions across departments for a shared understanding.

### Conflicting Metrics Detector
Automatically identifies and flags metrics with conflicting definitions between teams, prioritized by severity.

### Select a Metric to View Details
Explore individual KPIs and see how they are defined across different teams.

### Business Glossary

## 💡 Problem Statement

Misaligned KPIs waste months of effort across organizations:
- Marketing defines "conversion" differently than Sales.
- Product teams are left unsure which metric definitions to build against.

**Result:** Wasted resources, wrong product priorities, and lost business opportunities.

This tool solves the problem by **detecting and correcting metric misalignments early**.
